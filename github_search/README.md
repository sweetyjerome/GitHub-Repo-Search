# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up the code and available scripts

go inside the project directory:

### `cd github_search`

install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

then run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Short Description 

Created a basic app that searches the repoitories of a specific user using GitHub API.
Used [Material UI components and icons](https://mui.com/components/) for icons and certain components.
API calls are made using Axios.

### Future Improvements

*Refactor the code so as to make components reusable.
*write test cases
*Add more details in the UI and improve search funtionality by addidng clear search
*Use bootstrap to make it more responsive.
*Deploy the app.

### Feedback

I started the code from scratch and was not able to complete it as i had planned, but due to the time constraint submitting this. Tried deploying the code in [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/laughing-austin-138275/deploys/61fd53b6cc027a0009f98425), got [404 error](https://61fd53b6cc027a0009f98425--laughing-austin-138275.netlify.app/). Tried deploying in [Hrokuapp](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/git-profile-search/deploy/github), facing API fetch issues. Currently looking into it. :(
